\section{Discussion}
The results of figure \ref{fig::stein}, clearly show that Steiner's theorem is valid. All measured points are very close to the values calculated by Steiner's theorem. In addition, the calculated values lie within the confidence interval for all measured values.


Also for the second experiment we get similar results.
Here the moments of inertia of the dumbbell were investigated, it can be seen in figure \ref{fig::ellips} that the theory agrees with the measurements. 
From the measured values, a linear relationship can be seen, which points to the elliptical character of our construction.
Since an ideal calculated straight line is always inside of the confidence interval of the measurements.
The assumption made by the model is validated.
