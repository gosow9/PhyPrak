\section{Conclusion}

The results are showing that all the theories examined are working well. Furthermore we expect even better results if the precision of the measuring method get better. As example a electronic time stopper with a laser barrier to minimize the error. Furthermore we see that if the experiments would get done more times the results also could be improved.
