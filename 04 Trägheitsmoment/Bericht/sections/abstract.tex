\begin{abstract}
In this experiment we want to verify two theories regarding the moment of inertia of rigid bodies.
In the first part of the experiment, we want to verify Steiner's theorem, which describes the moment of inertia for an axis parallel to one passing through the body's centre of mass.
The second theory we want to verify states, that the moment of inertia of a body regarding different axes through the same point can be described as an ellipsoid.
The results of both experiments agree with the values calculated using said theories.
