\section{Results}


To verify how good Steiner's theorem is, we compare the measured moments of inertia with the values calculated using Steiner's theorem.
In figure \ref{fig::stein} the moments of inertia with different displacements are plotted against the displacement $d$ squared.
The measured values are laying on the linear line displaying the values calculated using the Steiner's theorem as seen in figure \ref{fig::stein}.

The results of measuring the oscillation period of a dumbbell in different axes of rotation on a plane, are plotted against the cosine squared of corresponding angle.
This is done to determine, if there is a linear behaviour.

	\caption{Plotting the measured period times against the cosine squared of the angle of the weight. }\label{fig::ellips}
\end{figure}

As we can see in figure \ref{fig::ellips} a clear linear behaviour is given.
The calculated values of an fitted linear model, are always inside the error bar of both axis.
Implying that the moments of inertia of a body rotated in a plane indeed behave elliptical.
