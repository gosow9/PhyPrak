\begin{abstract}
The abstract is a short summary of the experiment. It should
motivate the reader to actually read the whole paper. The length of
the abstract should not exceed 10 lines. Every section of the report
should be represented by one or two sentences. This includes the
results and the conclusions. There is no need to keep the reader in
suspense over the findings that you want to present. Often the
abstract is written last.
