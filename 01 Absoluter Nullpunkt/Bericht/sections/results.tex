\section{Results}

Our measurments and calculations as seen below lead us to the following result for absolute zero $t_0$:
\begin{align}
	t_0 = -276.7 \pm \SI{5.0}{\degreeCelsius} 
\end{align}
The exact result is $-273.150 \pm \SI{0.005}{\degreeCelsius}$, so our result range is off by around \SI{0.45}{\degreeCelsius}. We will discuss possible explanations for the incorrect result in a separate section below. 


Our result for the temperature $t_n$ of liquid nitrogen is:
\begin{align}
	t_n = -193.2 \pm \SI{3.7}{\degreeCelsius} 
\end{align}
with the boiling temperature of nitrogen at \SI{-195.8}{\degreeCelsius}.
