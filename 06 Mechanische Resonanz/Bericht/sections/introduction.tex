\subsection{Introduction}

The dampened harmonic oscillator is omnipresent in many if not all fields of physics. 
Despite often looking at idealized systems without dampening, in the real world there are always some imperfections which result in a dampening.
The best example here probably is friction. 
As dampening often is not dependent on time, we can assume that there is some constant $\alpha$ describing it.

Our goal in this experiment is to find the dampening constant $\alpha$ for three different dampenings.
We are able to do this in two different ways. 
In the first part, we want to use the dampened oscillation without any external force, and in the second part we look at a forced oscillation.
