\subsection{Data Analysis}
For the first experiment we followed the steps described in the subsection \ref{sec::exp}.
To determine the value $\alpha_{1}$, we taken all the measured amplitudes with the corresponding times and performed a least square fit on the expected model \ref{eq::model}.
The least square fit for $\alpha_1$ on the measured values is shown in figure \ref{fig::dampening} as an red dashed line.
Since this curve gets not very close to the measured values the measuring technique is probably not the most exact method used.
We expected an error of $\pm 2\degree$ while reading the scale in motion. 
But since the values changed very fast and the reading was done by eye an even grater uncertainty can be expected.

To calculate an error on the calculated decaying rate $\alpha_{1}$ another two fits were done.
For the first one $\alpha_{1max}$ we used the same set of data but added the estimated errors to the original values before performing the fit.
On the second one $\alpha_{1min}$ we subtracted the estimated error.
Having the maximum and minimum $\alpha_{1}$ we calculate the error 
\[
\Delta\alpha_1 = \frac{1}{2}(\alpha_{1max} - \alpha_{1min})
\]
This error is shown in figure \ref{fig::dampening} and figure \ref{fig::log} as the error band.

The same procedure as for the value $\alpha_1$ was done for $\alpha_{2,3}$.
resulting in the following values for $\alpha_{1, 2, 3}$:
\begin{align*}
&\alpha_1 = 0.057 \pm \SI{0.003}{\second^{-1}}\\
&\alpha_2 = 0.091 \pm \SI{0.006}{\second^{-1}}\\
&\alpha_3 = 0.141 \pm \SI{0.008}{\second^{-1}}
\end{align*}
