\subsection{Data Analysis}

We now want to estimate the dampening constants $\alpha_{1, 2, 3}$ using the resonance curves.
$\alpha$ is given as half of the width of the curve at height $A_{alpha} = A_{max}/\sqrt{2}$.
As we did one measurement per dampening at resonance frequency, this will be our value for $A_{max}$.
To estimate the value of the resonance curve at this height, we pick the four measurements $A_{up, 1}, A_{up, 2}, A_{down, 1}$ and $A_{down, 2}$.
