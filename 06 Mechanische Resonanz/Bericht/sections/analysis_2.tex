\subsection{Data Analysis}

We now want to estimate the dampening constants $\alpha_{1, 2, 3}$ using the resonance curves.
In order to do that, we need to know the width of the curve at the height $A_{max}/\sqrt{2}$.
To do this, we approximate the resonance curve between the two angular frequencies
