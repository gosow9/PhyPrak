\subsection{Experiment}
To perform this experiment we measure the amplitude $A$ of the system for different angular frequencies $\omega$ of the motor around the eigenfrequency $\omega_0$ of the system.
We do our measurements for $\omega$ in a range of around $\omega_0 \pm \SI{0.5}{\second^{-1}}$.
Because we will use the maximal frequency $A_{max}$ later, we do one measurement as close as possible to the Eigenfrequency $\omega_0$ of the system.
It is very important to let the system get to its stationary state after changing $\omega$, because before that, the amplitude oscillates quite a bit.
For each dampening, we measure between $12$ and $14$ different points.
