\subsection{Results}

The amplitudes $A$ measured in the first experiment can be seen in figure \ref{fig::log}.
There is an estimated error bar of $\pm 2  \degree$  for all values other than the first one.
The first value was fixed at an amplitude of $A_0=110 \degree$  with an $1 \degree$ scale, resulting in a $\pm 0.5 \degree$ error.
In figure \ref{fig::log} we see an linear behaviour of the measured values if plotted in a logarithmic scale getting close to the expected exponential decay.

	\caption{Measured amplitudes with an estimated error of $\Delta A = \pm2 \degree$  plotted on a logarithmic scale. Shown next to the exponential decay with $\alpha_{1, 2, 3}$ as decay rates and $A_0=110  \degree$  as starting value of the measurement. To every $\alpha$ value a calculated maximum and minimum error band is shown.}

The uncertainty $\Delta t$ of the measured time is in the magnitude of $0,4$s with the stop watch.
Since this is barly visible in the plot it was removed.
