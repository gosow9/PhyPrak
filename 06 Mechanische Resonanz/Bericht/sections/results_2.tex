\subsection{Results}
The resonance curves we measured can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig::resonance}.

The uncertainties on the amplitudes $A$ come from two different places.
First, we can not be entirely sure, that the system has reached its stationary state.
Second there is an uncertainty of $\pm 0.5 \degree$ because of the scale of the device itself.
We estimated the resulting uncertainty to $\Delta A = 2 \degree$.

The uncertainties of the angular frequencies $\omega$ come directly from the already calculated error on $C_T$ and the accuracy of the voltmeter.
Using Gaussian error propagation on formula (\ref{eq::calibration}) lets us calculate $\Delta \omega$ for every measurement. 
Those uncertainties are in the magnitude of $\Delta \omega \approx 0.005 s^{-1}$, so they can be ignored (that is also why they are not shown in Fig. \ref{fig::resonance}).
