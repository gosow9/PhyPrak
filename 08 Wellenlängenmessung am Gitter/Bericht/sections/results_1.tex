\subsection{Results}
We measured $a$ to be $a = 1000 \pm \SI{5}{\milli\meter}$.
The uncertainty comes from the ruler we use and because it is difficult to exactly say where to measure.


We first notice that this way of measuring $b$ is really hard to get right.
As we slightly move our head left and right to look through the grating the lines on the scale move as well.
It is very hard to actually look through the grating at the exact same spot for every measurement.
The second problem is that the spectral lines can be quite wide, reaching up to around \SI{5}{\milli\meter}. 
The uncertainty we get from the scale is $\pm \SI{2.5}{\milli\meter}$. 
We estimate the uncertainty coming from the two other reasons above to be another $\pm \SI{5}{\milli\meter}$. 
This gives us a total uncertainty on every measurement of $b$ as $\Delta b = \SI{7.5}{\milli\meter}$.
