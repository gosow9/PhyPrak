\subsection{Experiment}
In this second part of the experiment we precisely measure the wavelengths of the mercury spectrum with a grating spectrometer.
First we had to First, we had to adjust the telescope correctly, according to the procedure given by the manual\cite{manual}.
The setting includes the following five steps described in the manual \cite{manual}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focusing the telescope to infinity
	\item Vertical alignment of the telescope axis to the spectrometer axis
	\item Adjusting the collimator
	\item Vertical alignment of the grating to the collimator axis
	\item Adjusting the grating
\end{itemize}
