In this experiment the goal is to determine the wavelength of the spectral lines of a helium and a mercury lamp.
We measure the ones from helium with a simple method, mostly relying on our eyes, while using a spectrometer for the mercury lamp.
The results we find for the first method do match up with the literature values, while having a pretty big error because of the method itself.
The results of the second part suggest that we did not factor in all error sources correctly, because while the results are in the right area, they do not match up with the literature values.
