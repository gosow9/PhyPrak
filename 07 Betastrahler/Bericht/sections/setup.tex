\subsection{Setup}
The device we are using here is called a counter tube.
It consists of a capacitor filled with gas.
Every time an energetic particle enters the counter tube, the particle will ionize some of the gas particles, which will do the same thing again with other gas particles.
This leads to an avalanche of energetic particles that can be detected by the counter tube, resulting in one count. 
The time used to create this avalanche limits the counting rate of the counter tube.
Our counting tube has an integrated timer, so we can enter the amount of seconds we want it to run and it automatically counts for that amount of time.

As a source we use Strontium ($^{90}$Sr).
This first decays into Yttrium ($^{90}$Y), which itself is unstable and decays into the stable Zirconium( $^{90}$Zr).
For safety reasons, the source is covered by a thin \SI{0.1}{\milli\meter} layer of steel.
