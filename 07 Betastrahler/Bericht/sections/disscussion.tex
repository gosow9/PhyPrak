\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

So far you have discussed how you have obtained your data and the
quantities you derived from it. In this section you should discuss
the results in the context of physical laws. Depending on the
experiment you want to compare your result and its uncertainty with
the literature value. If you want to confirm a physical model that
explains a certain phenomenon you want to assess if this model
describes the data well within the confidence intervals, or whether
a simpler model describes the data just as well.
