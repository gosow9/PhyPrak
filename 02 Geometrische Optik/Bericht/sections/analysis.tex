\section{Data analysis}

All but one measurements were done on the same measuring rail with a  included \si{\milli \m}-scale. 
Since the later described error of focusing $e_f$ is way bigger, the following smaller sources are included in the focusing error.
In a setup with a \si{\milli \m} measuring rail the best reading accuracy is $0.5 \pm 0.25$\si{\milli \m}. 
If well done the parallax error can be included in this error margin, otherwise the parallax error can be added on top.
Depending on rail length and material a certain temperature error has to be included. 
Since the coefficient for most metals used in length measuring devices is in the magnitude of $10^{-5} \dots 10^{-6}$ per Kelvin.
Thus in a measurement like this errors are negligible.
